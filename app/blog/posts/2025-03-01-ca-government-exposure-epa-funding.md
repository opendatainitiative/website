The EPA has over $100 million in funding for seven California Environmental Justice Community Change Grants with several connections to California state government. 

1. The grants complement California's own state-level environmental justice initiatives, particularly CalEPA's Environmental Justice Action Grants Program established in 2023, which addresses similar environmental justice concerns in California communities[3][6].

2. California state agencies have invested over $2 billion in community-engaged climate change and environmental justice work, creating a parallel funding ecosystem to the federal EPA grants[7].

3. Nine California state agencies offered 32 grants related to climate change and environmental justice goals, including CalEPA, California Air Resources Board (CARB), California Department of Transportation (CDOT), Strategic Growth Council (SGC), California Energy Commission (CEC), California Department of Education (CDE), California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), Governor's Office of Planning and Research (OPR), and San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District[7].

4. The federal Community Change Grants often involve partnerships with local California governments, as eligible applicants include partnerships between community-based organizations and local governments[8][11].

5. California state representatives, including U.S. Senator Alex Padilla and Representatives Ted Lieu and Barbara Lee, have been actively involved in announcing and supporting these federal grants for California communities[4].

6. Some of the funded projects, such as the $20 million "GREEN San Gabriel Valley" initiative, involve coordination with local California government entities for implementation of environmental improvements like expanding tree canopy and greening schoolyards[2].

7. The federal grants target many of the same disadvantaged communities that California state programs prioritize, including California Native American Tribes, low-income communities, and communities of color[6][10].
