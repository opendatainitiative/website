# Groups and Individuals in California Tied to 2024 EPA Grant Distributions  

The Biden administration’s $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) grants, particularly the $20 billion allocated to eight nonprofits, have drawn scrutiny for their rapid distribution and potential conflicts of interest. Several California-based organizations are directly or indirectly linked to these grants, either as recipients, partners, or through leadership roles.

In summary, California serves as a critical hub for GGRF-funded projects, with organizations like **Climate United**, **Rewiring America**, and **Power Forward Communities** actively implementing initiatives.
